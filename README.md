<h1 align=center>Geometry Dash · Switch Port</h1>

A wrapper/port of the Android release of **Geometry Dash** (
`com.robtopx.geometryjump`). It loads the original arm64 game
binaries — `libcocos2dcpp.so` (RobTop's cocos2d-x 2.2 fork + the game) *and*
the stock `libfmod.so` — patches them and runs them inside a minimal
Android-like environment natively on the Switch.

### How to install

You need a **2.2.14x arm64** Android release; extract the files from your own
legally-owned copy of the game.

Create a folder `/switch/gdash` and fill it:

```
/switch/<anything>/
  gdash_nx.nro
  libcocos2dcpp.so        # from the APK's lib/arm64-v8a/
  libfmod.so              # from the APK's lib/arm64-v8a/
  assets/                 # the entire contents of the APK's assets/ folder
  config.txt              # created on first run
  save/                   # created on first run; game saves + prefs
```

### Notes

This will not run in applet/album mode — it needs the full memory of a game
override. Launch it by holding **R** while opening an installed title, or use
a forwarder.

`config.txt` is created on first run:

* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` auto-picks
  1280x720 handheld / 1920x1080 docked.
* `cursor_speed` — pointer speed of the stick-driven cursor, px/s at 720p.

### How to build

Install the devkitPro Switch toolchain and portlibs:

```sh
pacman -S devkitA64 switch-tools libnx switch-sdl2 switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau
```

Then `make`.
