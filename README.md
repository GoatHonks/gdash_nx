<h1 align=center>Geometry Dash · Switch Port</h1>

A wrapper/port of the Android releases of **Geometry Dash**, **Meltdown**,
**SubZero**, and **World**. It loads the original arm64 game binaries —
`libcocos2dcpp.so` (RobTop's cocos2d-x 2.2 fork + the game) and the stock
`libfmod.so` — patches them and runs them inside a minimal Android-like
environment natively on the Switch.

### How to install

You need a **2.2.14x arm64** Android release; extract the files from your own
legally-owned copy of the game.

Create a separate folder for each game you install and fill it:

```
/switch/<anything>/
  gdash_nx.nro
  libcocos2dcpp.so        # from the APK's lib/arm64-v8a/
  libfmod.so              # from the APK's lib/arm64-v8a/
  assets/                 # the entire contents of the APK's assets/ folder
  config.txt              # created on first run
  prefs.txt               # created on first run; includes anonymous network ID
  cacert.pem               # generated from the Switch firmware trust store
  save/                    # created on first run; game saves
```

For example, `/switch/gdash_full`, `/switch/gdash_meltdown`,
`/switch/gdash_subzero`, and `/switch/gdash_world` each keep an independent
save. Split APK/XAPK releases usually store the assets in the base APK and the
native libraries in `config.arm64_v8a.apk`. An `armeabi-v7a`-only release is
32-bit and cannot supply libraries for this arm64 port.

### Notes

This will not run in applet/album mode — it needs the full memory of a game
override. Launch it by holding **R** while opening an installed title, or use
a forwarder.

`config.txt` is created on first run:

* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` auto-picks
  1280x720 handheld / 1920x1080 docked.
* `cursor_speed` — pointer speed of the stick-driven cursor, px/s at 720p.

### Online features

Public leaderboards and level search/download use RobTop's native Boomlings HTTPS
client embedded in `libcocos2dcpp.so`; they do not require Google Play Games.
The port supplies the missing Switch socket ABI conversions, reports the real
console connection state, and keeps a random anonymous network ID in
`prefs.txt`. It does not read a Nintendo account or console identifier.

TLS peer and hostname verification are enabled at load time. `cacert.pem` is
regenerated from the Switch firmware's enabled public root certificates, so no
certificate file needs to be copied beside the NRO. Google Play sign-in stays
disabled. The public global leaderboard is fetched without the stock client's
anonymous score-upload bootstrap. Level-specific leaderboards require a logged-in
Geometry Dash account because Boomlings requires account authorization for that
endpoint. Score submission, comments, uploads, messaging, and other social
endpoints are outside the supported/tested scope of this port.

Networking is always enabled. Release builds do not write network diagnostic
logs or record request/response payloads, the anonymous ID, or credentials.

### How to build

Install the devkitPro Switch toolchain and portlibs:

```sh
pacman -S devkitA64 switch-tools libnx switch-sdl2 switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau
```

Then `make`.
